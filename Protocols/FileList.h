 * FileLists are stored in seperate NSBundles and are detected through the
 * ComponentManager system. Each FileList bundle must have a principle class
 * that implements the FileListFactory protocol.
 *
 * The NSBundle that contains a file list is expected to have a few properties:
 * * The Principle Class is expected to conform to the protocol FileListFactory
 * * The Info.plist file is expected to have the following keys that are used
 *   by the plugin system.
 *   * VSFLMenuName: The name of the menu as displayed in the view menu where 
 *     the user can switch FileLists
 *   * VSPluginName: The internal name of the plugin
 *   * VSPluginType: Always expected to be "FileList" with this type of plugin.
