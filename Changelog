0.6.1 Release
-------------
* Present the filesystem to the user like the Mac filesystem, not the Unix filesystem.
  (Use Machintosh HD:Users:name:... instead of /Users/name/ style paths.)
* Disable show/hide toolbar and customize toolbar when window isn't displayed...
* Autosave main window position
* Disable buttons in sort manager when you close VS window and then open sort manager.
* Adding a thumbnail doesn't change a file's modification time (which makes
  more sense since we aren't really modifying the file; just adding a piece of
  metadata on the filesystem).
* Option to show hidden files; we now hide stuff at the @"/" level by default.
* Advanced preference pane
* Fix problem where thumbnails on remote servers weren't being displayed after
  they were generated
* Some memory leaks were fixed.
* Now use RBSplitView to prevent that stupid crash that I reported last version.
* Because of RBSplitView, there is a "Show/Hide File List" option in the View menu.
* Tabbing between controls now works; Up/Down in the file list changes
* Added Next/Previous items to the Go menu for navigation when the file list is hidden.
* Use UTI types on 10.4.

0.6 Release
-----------
* A couple of speed fixes:
  * Entering a new directory is much faster. On my computer, entering a
    directory of 746 images took 5 seconds in 0.5.3. Now it takes less then
	a second.
  * Cut application startup time by a small amount.
  * More intelligent preloading behavior makes things "feel" faster.
  * Tiger fixes a problem with the AppKit that was causing me to do more 
    redraws then was neccessary. Slightly faster on Tiger (you'll notice it 
	only if you scroll through your files on a low memory machine).
* ICNS and Windows Bitmap (BMP) support.
* Stop assuming people have a "~/Pictures" folder. Some people have broken
  out of Apple's default hiearchy and we shouldn't make assumptions.
* Finally get rid of that annoying graphical glitch where thumbnails aren't
  drawn in certain circumstances.
* When an image won't fit in the viewing area, the user can now drag the
  image around with a hand cursor like they can in Preview.
* Change "Sort Manager" preferences to "Favorites." These paths are now
  used both in the Sort Manager and in the new "Favorite Locations" menu in 
  the "Go" menu and its corresponding toolbar item.
* Files with the wrong extension (JPEG files ending in GIF, PNG files
  ending in JPEG) are loaded, instead of raising an error.
* Move, Copy and Rename operations now check if they are overwriting a file
  and warn the user. 
* Move, Copy and Rename are now undoable. Undo for delete isn't implemented 
  yet. (I'm having problems figuring out the trash system, but I'll get it
  eventually).

0.5.3 Feature Release
---------------------
* Changed the SortManager so that the NSTableView takes up the entire window, 
  and also, made it resizable. I was testing it the other day and the lack of 
  resizing screwed things up.
* Allow drag and drop reordering in the Sort Manager Preferences.
* Ability to disable Preloading Images.
* Update help to reflect new Preload Images option.
* Credits.rtf -> Credits.html. Now with links instead of URLs!

0.5.2 Feature Release
---------------------
* You can now drag image files and folders to the VitaminSEE icon. I've
  registered VitaminSEE as a handler for folders, JPEGS, GIFs and TIFFs. Now
  all I need to do if figure out how to reigster with the Finder's "Open 
  With..." menu...

0.5.1 Bugfix Release
--------------------
* Fixed displaying of wrong filesize on files over 1 Megabyte.
* Fixed CRITICAL memory leak in thumbnailing code that was causing the program
  to crash.

0.5 Final
---------
* Cosmetic changes (HIG compliance)
* Add a "Known Issues" page to the help
* Make the GPL a Help menu item

0.5 Release Canidate 2
----------------------
* Fixed deadlock that would occur every half hour or so.=======
