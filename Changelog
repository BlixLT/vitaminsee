0.5.3 Feature Release
---------------------
* Changed the SortManager so that the NSTableView takes up the entire window, 
  and also, made it resizable. I was testing it the other day and the lack of 
  resizing screwed things up.
* Allow drag and drop reordering in the Sort Manager Preferences.
* Ability to disable Preloading Images.
* Update help to reflect new Preload Images option.
* Credits.rtf -> Credits.html. Now with links instead of URLs!

0.5.2 Feature Release
---------------------
* You can now drag image files and folders to the VitaminSEE icon. I've
  registered VitaminSEE as a handler for folders, JPEGS, GIFs and TIFFs. Now
  all I need to do if figure out how to reigster with the Finder's "Open 
  With..." menu...
