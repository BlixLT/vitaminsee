			<h1>Sorting images into folders</h1>
			<p>Clicking "Sort Manager" in the Window menu will bring up the Sort Manager. Each entry in the Sort Manager has a "Move" and a "Copy" button. Clicking on these buttons will move or copy the current image to the destination folder.</p>
			<p>Buttons are disabled when the destination path doesn't exist (for example, if you renamed the directory), or when the main window isn't open.</p>
			<p>The Sort Manager uses your Favorite locations. For information on setting your Favorite locations, click <a href="./preferences_2_Favorites.html">here</a>.</p>
